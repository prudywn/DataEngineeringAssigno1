# Python Basics: Key Concepts

This folder covers six foundational concepts in Python programming, each demonstrated in a dedicated file:

## 1. Variables (`variables.py`)
Learn how to declare, assign, and use variables in Python. This includes naming rules, assigning different data types, and using input/output with variables.

## 2. Data Types (`data-types.py`)
Explore Python's built-in data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. The file demonstrates type checking, type conversion, and operations involving different data types.

## 3. Data Structures (`data-structures.py`)
Understand Python's core data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Learn how to create, access, and manipulate these structures, and see examples of their unique properties.

## 4. Loops (`loops.py`)
Practice using `for` and `while` loops to iterate over data and perform repeated actions. The file includes examples of loop control statements like `break` and `continue`, as well as a simple guessing game challenge.

## 5. Control Flows (`control-flows.py`)
Master decision-making in Python using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, along with logical operators. The file includes practical examples such as eligibility checks and a grading system.

## 6. Functions (`funtions.py`)
Learn how to define and use functions in Python, including parameter passing, return values, and writing reusable code. The file also features a simple calculator function and function-based challenges.
